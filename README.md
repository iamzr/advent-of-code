# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This repository contains my personal solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, organized by year. Each year’s solutions can be found in their respective folders, with the code and inputs for the 25 days of puzzles.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── 2021/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 2022/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 2023/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

Each folder represents a specific year of the Advent of Code challenge (e.g., 2021/, 2022/, etc.).

Inside each folder, you will find:

- A README.md file specific to that year. This file contains details about the language, dependencies, and instructions for running the solutions for that year.

- Solution files for the corresponding days (e.g., day01.py for Day 1, day02.py for Day 2).

- Input files.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository

    ```commandline
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code-solutions.git
    cd advent-of-code-solutions
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired year

    ```commandline
    cd 2023
    ```

3. Read the README for that year.

    Each year might use a different programming language or framework. Open the README.md file in the year’s folder to find specific instructions for setting up dependencies and running the solutions:
    
    ```commandline
    cat README.md
    ```

4. Run the solution for a specific day. Follow the instructions in the year-specific README to execute a solution.

## Dependencies

Since each year might use a different programming language or setup, refer to the README.md file in the corresponding year’s folder for detailed information about required dependencies and installation instructions.
